This is the ontology concerning Water, Energy and Food derived by the European Directives:
• Article 2 of EU Directive 98/83/EC that defines the water intended for human consumption.
• Article 2 of EU Directive 2003/30/EC that defines bio-fuels.
• Article 2 of EU Regulation 178/2002/EC that defines food.

The goal is to model legal terms, coming from different legal definitions, in order to create a semantic connection among water, energy and food topics that are strictly linked for the climate change strategy.

Research presented in this ontology  is conducted as a PhD research at the University of Bologna -CIRSFID, with the contribution of University of Luxembourg within the Erasmus Mundus Joint International Doctoral (Ph.D.) programme in Law, Science and Technology. http://www.last-jd.eu
