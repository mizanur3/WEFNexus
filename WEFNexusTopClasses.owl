        <Literal datatypeIRI="&rdfs;Literal">In 1996, the “Rome Declaration on World Food Security and World Food Summit Plan of Action” by FAO declared the access to adequate food is a human right where water for human consumption is considered as food too. Following that declaration, since the beginning of 21st century, policy debate on food vs. fuel has raised public demonstration throughout the world, particularly in Brazil, US and Europe due to the dilemma regarding farmland use changes by rising biofuel production which reinforce negatively the food supply. That worldwide concern regarding Water-Energy-Food nexus has led controversy within the existing international and regional legal systems such as policy harmonization debates between EU and her member states regarding water, food and energy domains even though food as a sub-domain of common agricultural policy was predominately a common concern at the EU level since its origin. Concurrently, in 2010, UN Resolution 64/292 explicitly recognized human right to clean drinking water and German Federal Government initiated, for the first time as such, an on-line resource platform for Water-Energy-Food Security nexus funded by EU and in partnership with World Economic Forum, WEF and IFPRI. Subsequently Bonn Conference 2011 on ‘The water Energy Food Security Nexus – Solutions for the Green Economy’ recognized the nexus perspective and provided the guiding principles for the nexus which drawn outstanding policy discourse in the UN Conference on Sustainable Development held in Rio 2012. Consecutively, in 2012, US National Intelligence Council published their report on ‘Global Trends 2030: Alternative Worlds’, where the nexus is declared as the fourth out of five most emerging global trends. Since then, subsequently, many governments like US, Germany, Brazil etc. as well as regional and international organizations like EU, UNWater and OECD have started policy discourse on how to recognize nexus and manage nexus resources using innovation and technology while there is no legal definition of such nexus. Very recently, on 25 September 2015, UN Resolution 70/1 on ‘Transforming Our World: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development’ declared 17 sustainable development goals where goal 2, 6, and 7 deals with food, water and energy security respectively. In addition, paragraph 16 of the said Resolution explicitly specified the need to bridge digital divide and to develop knowledge society using ICT as a means. This utterance of the said UN Resolution is coherent with the EU Decision 456/2005/EC which clearly emphasised to make digital content in Europe more accessible, usable and exploitable. However, in the case of nexus, following major problems are not in favour of implementing mentioned UN Resolution and EU Decision - 
-	First of all the nexus domains are isolated and managed by segregated institutional settlement. For example, European Food Safely Authority is established by EU Regulation 178/2002 in order to only deal with common food issues in EU level, but not with water or energy issues. Therefore digital content of such authority is not shared with digital content of other counter parts like water or energy related institutions, vice versa. 
-	Secondly, there are a number of legal information databases related with nexus domains such as FAO-Lex, ECO-Lex, Eur-Lex, WISH, Food in open data, and legislative.gov.uk but these data-bases are not inter-connected as well as their information is not inter-operable and semantically searchable.   
-	Thirdly, there is a number of water and food related ontologies such as AGROVOC. SESAME-S, CUAHSI, SSN, SWEET, Towntology and hydrology, but they do not represent legal definition neither of water nor food nor ontological connection among nexus domains.
These mentioned problems in nexus domains create knowledge gaps in the nexus. For example, there is a lack of nexus detection mechanisms, lack of cross-compliance check among rules that affects and reinforces nexus domains and some of those rules are mutually exclusive in the nexus context. In order to minimize these problems and knowledge gaps in nexus, this legal ontology for nexus is build, which is in line with the EU Council’s conclusions inviting the introduction of the European Legislation Identifier (ELI) (2012/C 325/02). Considering the above contexts, the legal ontology for nexus is intended to provide following benefits – 
a)	It provides a legal definitional understanding for nexus that is machine processable and a formal specification of a shared understanding for nexus based on legal concepts those are laid down in the EU regulations.     
b)	It can be used as a basis to promote interchange and enhance interoperability between legal information systems related with nexus domains. 
c)	It can be reused by the Member States of EU for their own needs. That might decrease the total cost of developing nexus related legal information system. 
d)	It can be used to support case-based comparisons and testing different hypothesis of nexus. 
e)	In addition, the methodology of it can be applied to model legal ontology for other domains as well as jurisdictions.
The legal ontology for nexus is a merged ontology with following ontologies - WEFNexusTopClasses ontolgy, EUDefWater Ontology, EUDefBiofuels Ontology and EUDefFood Ontology. The WEFTopClasses Ontology is imported and reused in following ontologies - EUDefWater Ontology, EUDefBiofuels Ontology and EUDefFood Ontology.</Literal>

        <Literal datatypeIRI="&rdfs;Literal">Oxford dictionary defines the term ‘Activity’ as “a thing that a person or group does or has done”. In biology, the term ‘Activity’ is used to express a process, such as digestion, that any living organism performs in order to be alive. However in the case of legal definition of ‘Activity’, there is no such EU regulation directly defines it. The ‘Activity’ as a legal term with a particular meaning has been used in the Regulation (EC) No 716/2007 , where a list of ‘Activity’ is given for foreign administrative works and formal reporting purposes. Furthermore, a lot of terms  have been using in EU water, energy and food domains which can be a type of activity, but no EU legislation from these domains gave a proper legal definition of it. Therefore, the meaning of oxford dictionary of it used  and it is selected as a Top Class for the legal ontology for WEF Nexus in order to categorize all types activities mentioned in the EU water, biofuels and Food definitions. The term ‘Activity’ has two subclasses – ProductionActivity and ConsumptionActivity.

Article 3 of REGULATION (EC) No 716/2007 syas Member States shall submit to the Commission (Eurostat) data on foreign affiliates in respect of the characteristics, the economic activities and the geographical breakdown as referred to in Annexes I, II and III. However, Annexe III, provides a list of activities that Member States must follow in order to produce their corrosponding reporting.


It also can be addressed as a process (as digestion) that an organism carries on or participates in by virtue of being alive.

        <IRI>&wfetop;Animal</IRI>
        <Literal datatypeIRI="&rdfs;Literal">Biology dictionary defines animal as a living organism possess minimum following characteristics – being eukaryotic and multicellular, being heterotrophic and digesting food in internal chamber, lacking cell wall, being generally motile, embryos passes through a blastula stage and possessing specialized sensory organs. In addition, Article 3(5) of Regulation (EC) No 1069/2009  defines animal as any invertebrate or vertebrate animal. Furthermore, Article 2 of EU Directive 2003/30/EC mentions that one of the sources of biomass is animal substance by which biofuel are produced. This is why the term ‘Animal’ is used as one of the Top-classes.

The definition is in line with Article 3(5), of Regulation (EC) No 1069/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 October 2009 laying down health rules as regards animal by-products and derived products not intended for human consumption and repealing Regulation (EC) No 1774/2002, defines animal as any invertebrate or vertebrate animal.

        <IRI>&wfetop;Authority</IRI>
        <Literal datatypeIRI="&rdfs;Literal">There is no generic legal definition of the term ‘Authority’. However, there are many EU Regulations of specific domains by which the institutions are formed; each of such EU Regulations provides a legal definition of the term ‘Authority’ in order to cover that particular context and domains . However, the Business dictionary  defines authority as “institutionalized and legal power inherent in a particular job, function, or position that is meant to enable its holder to successfully carry out his or her responsibilities”.  This definition of the authority is also in compatible with following two other definitions – 

Definition 1 - Power that is legally and formally institutionalized in order to perform certain legal activities, generally domain based. 

Definition 2 – A legal personality or agency formed by government in order to per-form and achieve some policy goal. 
Now if above definitions are considered, it means that there is a multiple authority that exists in order to maintain each of EU WEF domains. Hence, the term ‘Authority’ must be a Top Class entity for WEF ontology, which may further contains name of domain specific authorities those are installed by various legislations. For example, Article 2 of EU Directive 98/83/EC does not define generic meaning of the term ‘Au-thority’, but mentioned the quality and wholesomeness of foodstuffs are checked by competent national authorities in the water domain.

These definitions are in line with Article 2(1)of REGULATION (EC) No 1925/2006, which says that ‘Authority’ means the European Food Safety Authority established by Regulation (EC) No 178/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 28 January 2002 laying down the general principles and requirements of food law, establishing the European Food Safety Authority and laying down procedures in matters of food safety&apos;.

        <IRI>&wfetop;ConstitutiveRule</IRI>
        <Literal datatypeIRI="&rdfs;Literal">Prof. John Searle in his works  mentioned that constitutive rule is to generate activity the origin of which is logically dependent on the rules. These rules can be generally two types – imperative as well as non-imperative or count-as. The most famous example of such rules is chess rules or rules of football. However, there is no such EU legislation that defines specifically the term ‘constitutive rules’. But Article 9(6) of Directive 2014/65/EU  clearly indicated the important of application of constitutive rules in business administration without defining the constitutive rules. It provides the legal reasoning ground for legalizing the activities inherited from the legal rules.
 
In the case of EU definitions of water, bio-fuels and food, there exist a number of constitutive rules that generate activities the origin of which are entirely dependent on the rules mentioned in the definition. For example, Article 2 of EU Directive 98/83/EC carries a constitutive rule is that water used in the food preparation must maintain the quality of the water intended for human consumption without compromising the wholesomeness of the foodstuffs. Because this rule simply generates a number of activities such as – (a) cleaning the water if it is waste water, (b) implication of water quality mentioned in the Annexes of EU Directive 98/83/EC, (c) investigating the wholesomeness of the foodstuffs when water is applied to it in according to the laws of the competent authority, and (d) etc. In order to perform these activities, it is also required to comply with other legal rules coming from EU energy and food Regulations. 
Therefore, in order to create a common ontological path for all constitutive rules coming from different EU Regulations, it has been selected as one of TopClasses.

In addition, interpretivism is a thesis about the fundamental or constitutive explanation of legal rights and obligations (powers, privileges, and related notions) or, for short, about the grounds of law. In the relevant sense, some fact grounds another when the latter obtains in virtue of the former; and the relation between the two facts is explanatory in a non-causal, metaphysical sense of constitutive determination.

Furthermore, Article 9(6)of Directive 2014/65/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 May 2014 on markets in financial instruments and amending Directive 2002/92/EC and Directive 2011/61/EU, clearly indicated the important of application of constitutive rules in business administration.

Prof. Searle also argues that the semantics of language can be seen as a &quot;series of systems of constitutive rules and that illocutionary acts are performed in accordance with these rules.&quot;  These are the rules he is out to identify as the goal of this essay.

Few examples of such terms are – ‘Feed’, ‘Cooking’, ‘FoodPreparation’, ‘Drinking’ etc.

This person is the central figure of law, as elsewhere, characterized by personal attributes of mind, intention, feelings, weaknesses, morality common to human beings, with rights and duties under the law”. In addition, Biology dictionary mentioned that human being also can be addressed as social animal that has capability of living life with inherent values and ethics. Inappropriately, there is no EU legislation carries the legal definition of the term ‘human being’. However, on one hand, Article 2 of EU Directive 98/83/EC defines the water that is particularly intended for human consumption, but the Directive did not define the meaning of ‘human being’. On the other hand, like EU water definition, Article 2 of EU Regulation 178/2002/EC defines food designed for human consumption but does not define the term ‘human’. As the term ‘human being’ is common at EU water and food definitions, it is used as a top class.

        <Literal datatypeIRI="&rdfs;Literal">Even though there is no specific EU legislation that defines the term ‘living organism’, Article 2(1) of Directive 2001/18/EC  defines organism as “any biological entity capable of replication or of transferring genetic material”. However, the Biology dictionary  defines living organism as “any organism or a living form that possesses or shows the characteristics of life or being alive. They provided 9 characteristics of living organism that includes 7 abilities – such as having organized structure, requires energy to survive, ability to reproduce/ grow/ metabolize/ respond to stimuli/ adapt to the environment/ move/ and respire. In the case of EU definitions of water, biofules and food, there mentions different types of living organisms without even defining the meaning of the term ‘living organism’. For example, the term ‘human’, ‘plant’, ‘animal’ is used in EU water, food and bio-fuel definitions respectively. As a result, it has been used as another top class with following three sub-classes.

This is in line with Article 2(1)of Directive 2001/18/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 March 2001 on the deliberate release into the environment of genetically modified organisms and repealing Council Directive 90/220/EEC defines organism as any biological entity capable of replication or of transferring genetic material.

        <Literal datatypeIRI="&rdfs;Literal">Even though there is no legal definition of the term ‘market’ exists in the EU Regulations, there are many EU legislations related with the term ‘internal market’, ‘single market’, and/or ‘relevant market’. EU Regulations related with single market  defines market in which free movement of goods, services, capital and persons is ensured and in which EU citizens can do business legally and are free to work, study and live. In the case of EU food and biofuels definition, there are many terms exist those have property relationship with the term ‘Market’. For example, Article 2 of EU Regulation 178/2002/EC mentions that if the meat is produced for the market, then it is considered as food, otherwise not. That also has direct and indirect property relationship with other terms exist in EU water and biofuel definitions. Hence, the term ‘Market’ is used as a top class.

Additionally, in EU competition law, a relevant market is a market in which a particular product or service is sold. It is the intersection of a relevant product market and a relevant geographic market. The European Commission defines a relevant market and its product and geographic components as follows:

1.A relevant product market comprises all those products and/or services which are regarded as interchangeable or substitutable by the consumer by reason of the products&apos; characteristics, their prices and their intended use;

2.A relevant geographic market comprises the area in which the firms concerned are involved in the supply of products or services and in which the conditions of competition are sufficiently homogeneous. 

The definition is in line with Regulation (EU) No 596/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 April 2014 on market abuse (market abuse regulation) and repealing Directive 2003/6/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council and Commission Directives 2003/124/EC, 2003/125/EC and 2004/72/EC.

For example, Article 2 of EU Regulation 178/2002/EC mentions the term ‘WaterSubstance’ which is used to produce ‘FoodProduct’. Another example is Article 2 of EU Directive 2003/30/EC mentions the terms such as ‘Biomass’, ‘BiodegradableFractionOfProduct’, ‘IndustrialWaste’,  by which biofuel is produced. Therefore, these terms are subclasses of the top-class ‘Material’.

All of these terms can be directed under the term ‘ProductionActivity’.

        <IRI>&wfetop;Quality</IRI>
        <Literal datatypeIRI="&rdfs;Literal">Even though there is no such EU legislation provide a generic definition of quality, EU Regulation 2023/2006  defines the term ‘good manufacturing practice (GMP)’ as “those aspects of quality assurance which ensure that materials and articles are consistently produced and controlled to ensure conformity with the rules applicable to them and with the quality standards appropriate to their intended use by not endangering human health or causing an unacceptable change in the composition of the food or causing a deterioration in the organoleptic characteristics thereof”. In addition, EU Directive 98/83/EC also provides quality standard of water intended for human consumption, without giving a definition of what is quality, and EU Regulation 178/2002/EC also indicates the quality of food as wholesomeness of the foodstuff, but does not clarify the meaning of wholesomeness. In the case of EU biofuels definition, EU Directive 2003/30/EC says that biofuels must be made out of biomass, not from other materials and/or substance, which indicates ‘biomass’ as a quality material sources for producing biofuels. It means there are many terms in EU water, biofuels and food definitions those concern with the top-class ‘quality’.

        <IRI>&wfetop;Resource</IRI>
        <Literal datatypeIRI="&rdfs;Literal">Source and resource are two different words with totally different meanings. Source is a place or a thing that provides us what we are looking for. We go to school to obtain knowledge and to a college to obtain a degree. In this sense, these are sources of knowledge and degree for us. A well is a source of fresh underground water for us while the sun is a source of constant energy. There is another word resource that means something valuable for us and something that we consume to serve a function. This article attempts to differentiate between source and resource, to make readers use the right word in the right context.

Sources vs Resources

• Source is a place or a thing for a useful entity. We eat fruits and vegetables as they are sources of energy and vitamins and minerals for our bodies.

• Resource is a valuable thing that is necessary for a people or a nation. Sun is a resource of renewable energy for us.

• We are always on the lookout for sources of resources that are important for us.

• People are also considered important and invaluable resource for any organization

• Natural resources of a country are its mineral wealth, water bodies and fossil fuels

Miller and Spoolman (2011)  defined resources  as materials, services, knowledge or other assets that are converted to produce some benefits and/or satisfy some needs. Even though there is no specific legal definition of it in EU legislations, many EU regulations indirectly used this term in order to produce some important constitutive rules. For example, Article 2 of EU Directive 2003/30/EC mentions that the source of biofuels is biomass as a renewable energy source, but does not indicate that biofuel itself is a renewable energy resource. Another example, Article 2 of EU Regulation 178/2002/EC says that water-substance itself is a food as well as the source of food. However these legislations indirectly expresses that biofuel and water itself are resources. Hence the term ‘Resource’ is used as a top-class.

        <IRI>&wfetop;Source</IRI>
        <Literal datatypeIRI="&rdfs;Literal">Oxford dictionary defines source as “a place, person, or thing from which something comes or can be obtained”. In addition, even though EU Directive 2003/30/EC does not define what is source, it mentions the term ‘source’ in its Article 2(1)(c) saying that “other renewable fuels’ means renewable fuels, other than biofuels, which originate from renewable energy sources as defined in Directive 2001/77/EC (2) and used for transport purposes”. Also Article 2 of EU Directive 98/83/EC implicitly mentions that original water also can be a source of water intended for human consumption. Furthermore, Article 2 of EU Regulation 178/2002/EC likewise mentions that ‘water’ can be a source of food. As all of EU water, biofuels and food definitions have some terms and property relationships with the term ‘source’, it has been used as a top-class.

The entity &apos;&apos;Resource&apos;&apos; and &apos;&apos;Source&apos;&apos; has two independent meaning. Please see the annotations of &apos;&apos;Resource&apos;&apos;.

        <IRI>&wfetop;Substance</IRI>
        <Literal datatypeIRI="&rdfs;Literal">In US cases , the term ‘substance’ has been defined as essential part of a thing as distinguished from form. In EU, Article 3(2) of Regulation (EU) No 649/2012  says that substance’ means any chemical element and its compounds as defined in point 1 of Article 3 of Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 .  In the case of EU water, biofuels and food definitions, there are a lot of terms can be categorized as type of substance such as ‘AnimalSubstance’, ‘Carbon’, ‘Contaminant’, ‘PsychotropicSubstance’, ‘TobaccoSubstance’, ‘Water’, ‘VegetalSubstance’, ‘FoodSubstance’ etc. Therefore, the term ‘Substance’ is used as a top-class.

This definition is in line with Article 3(2) of Regulation (EU) No 649/2012 says that substance’ means any chemical element and its compounds as defined in point 1 of Article 3 of Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006.
